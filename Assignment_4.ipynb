        "3. **Indexing and Slicing**: Both lists and strings support indexing and slicing operations. You can access individual elements or subsequences of elements using square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Immutable vs. Mutable**: While strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation), lists are mutable (can be modified after creation). However, both types support operations like concatenation, replication, and slicing that create new instances rather than modifying the original data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Length**: Both lists and strings have a length, which can be obtained using the `len()` function. The length represents the number of elements in the list or characters in the string.\n",

        "6. **Iterative Operations**: Many iterative operations and functions work similarly with both lists and strings.

        "\n",
        "Ans.Tuples and lists are both sequence data types in Python, but they have some key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mutability**:\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements after creation. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.\n",
        "   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, you cannot change the elements they contain. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.\n",

        "2. **Syntax**:\n",
        "   - Lists are created using square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
        "   - Tuples are created using parentheses `( )`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performance**:\n",
        "   - Due to their immutability, tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
        "   - Lists, being mutable, may require more memory and may have slightly slower performance when modifying elements or resizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use Cases**:\n",
        "   - Lists are commonly used for storing collections of similar items where the order and number of elements may change, or when you need to modify the contents of the collection.\n",
        "   - Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, database records, or function return values. They are useful in situations where immutability and the fixed nature of the collection are desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a simple example illustrating the differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# List\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python's `copy` module, both `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()` are used to create copies of objects, but they differ in their behavior, particularly when dealing with nested objects such as lists of lists or dictionaries containing other dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`copy.copy()`**: This function creates a shallow copy of an object. A shallow copy creates a new object, but it doesn't create copies of the nested objects within the original object. Instead, it just copies the references to those nested objects. This means that changes to nested objects in the copied object will affect the original object, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    import copy\n",
        "    \n",
        "    original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",

        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`copy.deepcopy()`**: This function creates a deep copy of an object. A deep copy creates a completely new object and recursively copies the objects found nested within the original object. This means that changes to nested objects in the copied object will not affect the original object, and vice versa.\n",
